Tic Tac Toe using JS and Factory Functions

Nov 12, 2025

Create basic HTML, CSS and JS files
Check link and script src for functionality
Add Basic functions in to JS to create players, draw game board, add player marker to board, 
switch player turns, check for winning conditions and play through a basic game in the console

Still need to work on a proper function to check for a draw
Still need to work on a proper method to determine if a cell is already filled and to allow 
the player to pick a new cell without causing a feedback loop
Still need to re-work functions into factories to share variables and to encapsulate the whole game in a module
